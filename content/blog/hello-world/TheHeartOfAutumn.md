I was looking through the window

into the heart of Autumn ...

those disappointed trees ...

sometimes debarked...

perhaps a little annoyed ...

of not having clothes,

of losing their hands ...

now yellow ... and heavy!

I was looking, through the window,

into the heart of Autumn ...

those flowers, now sick,

crying silently,


waiting for the heat

for so many hours,

three thousand and eighty...maybe,

to laugh happily

once more again!

I was looking through the window,

into the heart of Autumn ...

abandoned colours,

mixed a little together

and all... a little ... copperish:

“A performing choir of colours...

singing about melancholy

and so much ... of nostalgia!”
