I was looking through the window 

into the heart of Autumn; 

Those disappointed Trees ... 

sometimes debarked, 

perhaps a little annoyed  

of not having clothes and 

of losing their hands... 

yellow ... and heavy! 

I was looking through the window   

into the heart of Autumn...  

those sick Flowers... 

that cry silently  

waiting for the heat to come...  

when they will laugh happily  

once more again! 

I was looking through the window 

into the heart of Autumn... 

those abandoned Colours, 

all mixed and copperish: 

“A performing Choir of Tints 

that sing about Melancholy             

 and so much of... Nostalgia too!”
