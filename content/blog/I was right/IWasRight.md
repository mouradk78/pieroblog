Credevo vero... d’essere giusto,  

quando un bel giorno... io_sprofondai!  

    Non mi trovavo...ero perduto,  

 pure lo specchio... era oscurato: 

    “Se n’era andato... anche il mio... ‘Io’!” 

             Andai a Lui solo ...amico e Dio...  

    che mi rispose, parlando dolce:  

“Quello che dai non e’ poi tanto... 

 se la persona che ti sta accanto 

         sente paura... ed anche dolore; 

Prova tu a darle... pure il mio amore!

I really thought ... I was always right, 

when one fine day ... I sank! 

    I couldn't find myself ... I was lost, 

even the mirror ... was obscured: 

    "Even my "I"...was gone!" 

 I went to Him alone ... my friend and my God ... 

    who answered me, speaking sweetly: 

"What you give is not so much ...  

if the person next to you 

         feels fear ... and even pain;  

Try to give ... my Love too!
